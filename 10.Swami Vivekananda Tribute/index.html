            <p>Swami Vivekananda (12 January 1863 â€“ 4 July 1902) was an Indian Hindu monk and a key figure in the introduction of Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. He is best known for his speech at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893, which began with the words "Sisters and brothers of America..." and introduced Hinduism to the Western world. Vivekananda played a major role in the revival of Hinduism in India and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India.</p>
